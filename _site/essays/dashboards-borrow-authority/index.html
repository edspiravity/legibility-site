        <h1>Dashboards Borrow Authority</h1>
      
      <p class="meta">2026</p>
<p>Most dashboards look reasonable.</p>
<p>They use familiar charts.<br>
They show the numbers people expect to see.<br>
They are reviewed regularly, refined over time, and widely accepted.</p>
<p>And yet, many leaders will admit—quietly—that some dashboards leave them uneasy.</p>
<p>Not because anything is obviously wrong,<br>
but because confidence seems to rise faster than understanding.</p>
<p>This discomfort is often misattributed.</p>
<p>It is blamed on poor visualization, misaligned metrics, or lack of clarity.</p>
<p>Those explanations rarely capture what is actually happening.</p>
<p>The issue is not design.<br>
It is authority.</p>
<h2>Compression</h2>
<p>Dashboards exist for a simple reason:</p>
<p>reality does not fit into a meeting.</p>
<p>Organizations are complex systems.<br>
They involve uncertainty, trade-offs, partial information, and evolving assumptions.</p>
<p>Dashboards compress all of this into symbols that people can absorb quickly—<br>
numbers, colors, trends, rankings.</p>
<p>This compression is not a flaw.<br>
It is the point.</p>
<p>Without compression, decision-making would stall.<br>
With it, leaders can act.</p>
<p>But compression is always lossy.</p>
<p>It removes nuance, context, and uncertainty.<br>
And when what is removed is no longer visible, the symbols that remain begin to carry more weight than they should.</p>
<h2>Borrowed Authority</h2>
<p>Dashboards do not decide anything.</p>
<p>They do not set targets.<br>
They do not define acceptable risk.<br>
They do not determine thresholds or priorities.</p>
<p>Those decisions are made elsewhere.</p>
<p>In planning sessions.<br>
In risk committees.<br>
In budget approvals.<br>
In policy discussions.<br>
In analytical judgment calls.</p>
<p>Dashboards inherit the outcomes of those decisions<br>
and present them in compressed form.</p>
<p>In that sense, dashboards borrow authority.</p>
<p>They borrow it from meetings,<br>
from governance structures,<br>
from people who are not present when the dashboard is later viewed.</p>
<p>This borrowing is not a problem—</p>
<p>until it becomes invisible.</p>
<h2>The Familiar Moment</h2>
<p>Most senior leaders will recognize this moment.</p>
<p>A dashboard is opened in a meeting.<br>
A prominent indicator is green.<br>
No one questions it.<br>
The conversation moves on.</p>
<p>The status is not wrong.</p>
<p>It reflects thresholds that were once discussed,<br>
assumptions that once made sense,<br>
data that was once reviewed.</p>
<p>But the provenance is gone.</p>
<p>No one in the room can see:</p>
<p>how the threshold was chosen<br>
when it was last revisited<br>
what uncertainty lies beneath it<br>
what would cause it to change</p>
<p>The dashboard does not explain these things.</p>
<p>It does not need to,<br>
because it feels authoritative.</p>
<p>And so the meeting proceeds with a quiet assumption:</p>
<p>this is under control.</p>
<p>What, exactly, is being trusted?</p>
<h2>Invisibility</h2>
<p>This is how authority becomes invisible.</p>
<p>Decisions are made in one context,<br>
by specific people,<br>
under specific conditions.</p>
<p>Dashboards compress those decisions into symbols.<br>
Over time, the connection disappears.</p>
<p>What remains looks objective:</p>
<p>a color<br>
a score<br>
a trend<br>
a delta</p>
<p>The symbol begins to feel like truth<br>
rather than judgment.</p>
<p>At that point, the dashboard is no longer summarizing decisions.</p>
<p>It is standing in for them.</p>
<p>This is not a failure of intent.<br>
It is a structural outcome of compression without traceability.</p>
<h2>Discomfort</h2>
<p>When leaders say a dashboard “feels off,”<br>
they are often responding to this gap.</p>
<p>Judgment is present,<br>
but its origin is unclear.</p>
<p>Confidence is signaled,<br>
but accountability is diffused.</p>
<p>Uncertainty has been removed,<br>
but not acknowledged.</p>
<p>Even when the data is correct,<br>
something feels missing.</p>
<p>This discomfort is epistemic, not aesthetic.</p>
<p>It arises when authority is implied<br>
but cannot be traced.</p>
<h2>The Executive Context</h2>
<p>This dynamic is most pronounced at senior levels.</p>
<p>Executive dashboards are:</p>
<p>the most compressed<br>
the least contestable<br>
the longest-lived<br>
the most trusted</p>
<p>They are designed to reduce cognitive load.<br>
They are meant to reassure as much as they inform.</p>
<p>But the more compressed a view becomes,<br>
the more responsibility it carries.</p>
<p>At senior levels,<br>
simplicity does not reduce obligation.</p>
<p>It increases it.</p>
<h2>A Shift in Expectation</h2>
<p>None of this suggests that dashboards should explain everything.<br>
Nor does it imply that executives need more detail.</p>
<p>It points instead to a subtle shift in expectation.</p>
<p>Some dashboards make it possible to see:</p>
<p>where judgment entered<br>
whose authority is being reflected<br>
what assumptions are in play<br>
what uncertainty remains</p>
<p>They do not overwhelm.<br>
They do not defend themselves.</p>
<p>They simply avoid presenting borrowed authority<br>
as if it were intrinsic truth.</p>
<p>This is not transparency for its own sake.</p>
<p>It is epistemic responsibility.</p>
<h2>The Question</h2>
<p>As dashboards continue to shape decisions,<br>
narratives,<br>
and confidence,</p>
<p>one question becomes harder to ignore:</p>
<p>Not<br>
“Is this dashboard green?”</p>
<p>But<br>
“What authority is this dashboard borrowing—<br>
and can I see the receipt?”</p>
<p>That question does not resolve the tension.</p>
<p>But it names it.</p>
