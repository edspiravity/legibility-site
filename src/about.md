Legibility.site publishes essays about how complex things are made easier to see, understand, and act on — and what changes when they are.

In many areas of modern life, representations stand in for reality. Dashboards stand in for situations. Scores stand in for judgment. Summaries stand in for understanding. Visibility stands in for accountability. Over time, these representations become the primary way decisions are made.

This site exists to examine that shift.

The essays here are not guides or recommendations. They do not offer frameworks, best practices, or solutions. Instead, they look closely at how clarity is produced, why it becomes convincing, and how it quietly reshapes judgment once it does.

Legibility.site is interested in moments when something feels obvious, neutral, or self-explanatory — and asks how it came to feel that way.

The subjects may vary. One essay may look at dashboards or metrics. Another may look at rankings, interfaces, rituals, or practices far removed from technology. What connects them is not the topic, but the process: how something becomes readable enough to replace direct engagement, and what is lost or displaced when that happens.

This is not a site about optimization or improvement. It does not argue for reform or propose alternatives. Many essays end without conclusions, deliberately.

The aim is simply to notice what happens when legibility succeeds — especially when it becomes so familiar that it fades into the background.
