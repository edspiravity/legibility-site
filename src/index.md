Legibility.site is a place for essays about how things become easy to see and act on — and what changes when they do.

Dashboards, metrics, summaries, rankings, and interfaces help us make sense of complex situations at scale. Over time, they don’t just help us understand what’s happening — they start to shape what we notice, what we trust, and how we decide.

This site isn’t about fixing or improving systems. It’s about paying attention to how clarity, once established, quietly reshapes judgment and authority.
